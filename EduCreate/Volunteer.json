Lightening up someone’s mood is probably one of my talents that I have and I enjoy doing it. I play basketball competitively in AAU and also my school team, and I absolutely love the sport. I have a passion for biology and I have interned for two years at a ucsf neurological lab participating in research aimed at curing babies who have suffered from a condition called hypoxia ischemia that cuts off their oxygen supply to their brains. Recently my team and I won third place out of sixteen teams in the BIOEHSC Competition held online and hosted by UC Berkeley.

I also love history, especially controversies and theories in World War Two such as the argument of whether or not the dropping of the atomic bomb was reasonable. Whenever I have free time, I would read history books whether it be nonfiction about Julius Caesar and his methodology or fiction like the hilarious book about World War Two pilots Catch 22. I also read about the holocaust and different accounts of survivors telling their stories about the cruelty of the Nazi regime.

So I looked into any way I could to help make knowledge accessible to all kids especially during this time of crisis but it was hard to find tutoring programs that fit into my schedule let alone find any at all.

As I grew older, this since inspiration from my early years guided me into becoming passionate about math and science. I enjoy, to this day, solving problems and competing in math contests. While I do enjoy competition, social help and community service is an area that moves me a deeper level. I help senior citizens at a veteran's center and also host camps of my own at local libraries throughout the year. I also am a member of the Boy Scouts of America, working towards the Eagle rank. I find tennis enjoyable to watch as well as play.",
        "reason":"The amount of damage that this virus has been causing to families is enormous, whether it be financially, mentally, physically, etc. One area that is often forgotten is education. Most schools nationwide are closing to help stop the spread of the virus. Unfortunately, this creates setbacks with many school children, especially in their younger years. Although schools have implemented online platforms, there are still a lot of schools that do not have the funding or adequate resources to accomplish this. Education of any sorts should not be something that is unavailable to kids. I really hope through this program I am able to improve young talent, even if it's one person, and put them on successful route for the future. Self-confidence is something that is also lacking in these stressful times and my goal, through these virtual lessons, is to rebuild that confidence and mental strength through a fun, interactive educational experience. Additionally, virtual tutoring is something that I have never tried and I would love to try this new platform out.",

        "description":"Curiosity has always played a big role in my life. Ever since a young age, I have always been inquisitive about many things in everyday life. As I grew older, this since inspiration from my early years guided me into becoming passionate about math and science. I enjoy, to this day, solving problems and competing in math contests. While I do enjoy competition, social help and community service is an area that moves me a deeper level. I help senior citizens at a veteran's center and also host camps of my own at local libraries throughout the year. I also am a member of the Boy Scouts of America, working towards the Eagle rank. I find tennis enjoyable to watch as well as play.",
        "reason":"The amount of damage that this virus has been causing to families is enormous, whether it be financially, mentally, physically, etc. One area that is often forgotten is education. Most schools nationwide are closing to help stop the spread of the virus. Unfortunately, this creates setbacks with many school children, especially in their younger years. Although schools have implemented online platforms, there are still a lot of schools that do not have the funding or adequate resources to accomplish this. Education of any sorts should not be something that is unavailable to kids. I really hope through this program I am able to improve young talent, even if it's one person, and put them on successful route for the future. Self-confidence is something that is also lacking in these stressful times and my goal, through these virtual lessons, is to rebuild that confidence and mental strength through a fun, interactive educational experience.

As a child, I was the type to fervently bombard my parents with all sorts of questions, everything from “how do lightsabers work” to “how did the universe begin”. I attribute this intellectual curiosity to my early participation in activities like math and science clubs, where I found learning to be quite enjoyable. Ever since, I’ve expanded my scientific knowledge by becoming involved in a number of academic olympiads and taking university classes through my school’s concurrent enrollment program. Most notably, I qualified for the USA Physics Olympiad and received a medal. On a similar note, I founded a physics club at my high school where I help tutor my fellow classmates for AP and SAT subject test exams. Otherwise, I am an avid athlete and have been participating in track and field and cross country since 6th grade. I’ve had the honor of qualifying and receiving honors at a few national competitions throughout middle school and high school. Overall, I’m looking forward to helping as many students as I can!",

Additionally, throughout high school, I've found that my best learning happens in an interactive peer environment, so I think a virtual tutoring program would work wonders. ",
